                                                                 Part 3 Intermediate Level AWS interview questions :

31. How do you secure data at rest and in transit in AWS?
Ans:- At rest: Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption of stored data, services like S3, EBS, and RDS provide server-side encryption options.
In transit: Use SSL/TLS protocols to secure data transfer. Services like S3, CloudFront, and API Gateway support encryption in transit.

32. Explain the difference between AWS S3 Standard and S3 Glacier.
Ans: S3 Standard is designed for frequently accessed data, offering low latency and high availability. It is more expensive but optimized for real-time access.
S3 Glacier: Designed for long-term archiving and infrequently accessed data. It is cheaper, but retrieval times can range from minutes to hours.

33. How does AWS S3 versioning work?
Ans:- S3 versioning allows you to store multiple versions of an object within a bucket. When enabled, S3 retains older versions of objects, helping to recover from accidental overwrites, deletions, or corruptions.

34. What is AWS ElastiCache?
Ans:- AWS ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory caching service that supports Redis and Memcached. It helps improve the performance of web applications by retrieving data from fast, managed in-memory caches instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.

35. Explain the concept of a bastion host.
Ans:- A bastion host is a server used to securely connect to instances in a private subnet of your VPC. It acts as a gateway, allowing you to securely SSH or RDP into your instances, while reducing the attack surface.

36. How do you implement high availability in AWS?
Ans:- Use services like EC2 Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), and deploying across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). For databases, you can use RDS Multi-AZ deployments or Aurora Global Database.

37. What is AWS Direct Connect?
Ans:- AWS Direct Connect is a dedicated network connection from your on-premise environment to AWS, allowing for secure, private, and high-bandwidth connectivity with lower latency compared to internet-based connections.

38. What are AWS Managed Services?
Ans:- AWS Managed Services (AMS) provides operational management for AWS infrastructure, handling tasks such as patch management, monitoring, backups, and security. It helps automate common activities and enforce security best practices.

39. What is AWS Config?
Ans:- AWS Config is a service that tracks and records configurations of your AWS resources over time. It helps you assess compliance, identify configuration changes, and troubleshoot resource configuration issues.

40. How do you set up cross-region replication in S3?
Ans:- Cross-region replication (CRR) in S3 allows automatic replication of objects from one S3 bucket to another in a different AWS region. You can enable it in the bucket settings, selecting a destination bucket and configuring any IAM roles and permissions.

Hey Everyone,
I had an interview with an MNC today, which went on for about 40 minutes. The discussion primarily revolved around AWS and DevOps topics.

üîπ AWS Networking & Security
 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), and why is it important?
 2Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between Public and Private Subnets?
